[README 中文版](./README-CN.md)

**[Baetyl](https://baetyl.io) is an open edge computing framework that extends cloud computing, data and service seamlessly to edge devices.** It can provide temporary offline, low-latency computing services, and include device connect, message routing, remote synchronization, function computing, video access pre-processing, AI inference, etc. The combination of Baetyl and the **Cloud Management Suite** of [BIE](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/bie.html)(Baidu IntelliEdge) will achieve cloud management and application distribution, enable applications running on edge devices and meet all kinds of edge computing scenario.

## Advantages

- **Shielding Computing Framework**: Baetyl provides two official computing modules(**Local Function Module** and **Python Runtime Module**), also supports customize module(which can be written in any programming language or any machine learning framework).
- **Simplified Application Production**: Baetyl combines with **Cloud Management Suite** of BIE and many other productions of Baidu Cloud(such as [CFC](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/cfc.html), [Infinite](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/infinite.html), [Jarvis](http://di.baidu.com/product/jarvis), [IoT EasyInsight](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/ist.html), [TSDB](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/tsdb.html), [IoT Visualization](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/iotviz.html)) to provide data calculation, storage, visible display, model training and many more abilities.
- **Quickly Deployment**: Baetyl pursues docker container mode, it make developers quickly deploy Baetyl on different operating system.
- **Deploy On Demand**: Baetyl takes modularization mode and splits functions to multiple independent modules. Developers can select some modules which they need to deploy.
- **Rich Configuration**: Baetyl supports X86 and ARM CPU processors, as well as Linux, Darwin and Windows operating systems.

## Components

As an edge computing platform, **Baetyl** not only provides features such as underlying service management, but also provides some basic functional modules, as follows:

- Baetyl [Master](./doc/us-en/overview/Design.md#master) is responsible for the management of service instances, such as start, stop, supervise, etc., consisting of Engine, API, Command Line. And supports two modes of running service: **native** process mode and **docker** container mode
- The official module [baetyl-agent](./doc/us-en/overview/Design.md#baetyl-agent) is responsible for communication with the BIE cloud management suite, which can be used for application delivery, device information reporting, etc. Mandatory certificate authentication to ensure transmission security;
- The official module [baetyl-hub](./doc/us-en/overview/Design.md#baetyl-hub) provides message subscription and publishing functions based on the [MQTT protocol](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html), and supports four access methods: TCP, SSL, WS, and WSS;
- The official module [baetyl-remote-mqtt](./doc/us-en/overview/Design.md#baetyl-remote-mqtt) is used to bridge two MQTT Servers for message synchronization and supports configuration of multiple message route rules. ;
- The official module [baetyl-function-manager](./doc/us-en/overview/Design.md#baetyl-function-manager) provides computing power based on MQTT message mechanism, flexible, high availability, good scalability, and fast response;
- The official module [baetyl-function-python27](./doc/us-en/overview/Design.md#baetyl-function-python27) provides the Python2.7 function runtime, which can be dynamically started by `baetyl-function-manager`;
- The official module [baetyl-function-python36](./doc/us-en/overview/Design.md#baetyl-function-python36) provides the Python3.6 function runtime, which can be dynamically started by `baetyl-function-manager`;
- The official module [baetyl-function-node85](./doc/us-en/overview/Design.md#baetyl-function-node85) provides the Node 8.5 function runtime, which can be dynamically started by `baetyl-function-manager`;
- SDK (Golang) can be used to develop custom modules.
