This document mainly provides related issues and solutions for OpenEdge deployment and startup in various platforms.

**Question 1**: Prompt missing startup dependency configuration item when starting OpenEdge in docker container mode.

**Suggested Solution**: As shown in the above picture, OpenEdge startup lacks configuration dependency files, refer to [OpenEdge Design Document](./overview/OpenEdge-design.md) and [GitHub Project Open Source Package](https://github.com/baidu/openedge) to supplemented with the corresponding configuration file in the folder named `example`.

**Question 2**: Execute the command `docker info` get the following result on Ubuntu/Debian:

```
WARNING: No swap limit support
```

**Suggested Solution**:

1. Open `/etc/default/grub` with your favorite text editor. Make sure the following lines are commented out or add them if they don't exist:

	> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1"

2. Save and exit and then run: `sudo update-grub` and reboot.

***Notice:*** If you got some error when you execute step2, it may be that the `grub` setting is incorrect. Please repeat steps 1 and 2.

**Question 3**: WARNING: Your kernel does not support swap limit capabilities. Limitation discarded.

**Suggested Solution**: Refer to Question 2.

**Question 4**: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.38/images/json: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.

Add the docker group if it doesn't already exist:

```shell
sudo groupadd docker
```

Add the current user to the docker group:

```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
su - ${USER}
``` 

**Question 5**: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?

If you still report this issue after the solution of Question 4 solution is executed, restart the docker service.

For example, execute the following command on CentOs:

```shell
systemctl start docker
```

**Question 6**: failed to create master: Error response from daemon: client version 1.39 is too new. Maximum supported API version is 1.38.

workaround is to pass API version via environment variable:
DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.38

For example, execute the following command on CentOs:

```shell
export DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.38
```
