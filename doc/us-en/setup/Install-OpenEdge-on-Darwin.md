# Install OpenEdge On Darwin

> OpenEdge is mainly developed in Go programming language and supports two startup modes: ***docker*** container mode and ***native*** process mode.

This document focuses on the installation and configuration of the environment required for OpenEdge and the rapid deployment of OpenEdge on the Darwin system.

## Environment Configuration

### Install Docker

> OpenEdge offers two startup modes. To start using ***docker*** container mode (recommended), you need to complete the docker installation first.

**Notice:**

+ The official Dockerfile is offered for multi-stage builds. If you need to build the relevant image yourself, The version of docker you installed should be above 17.05.
+ The production environment can run the image using a lower version of Docker, which is currently tested to a minimum usable version of 12.0.
+ According to the [Official Release Log](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#18092), the version of Docker lower than 18.09.2 has some security implications. It is recommended to install/update the Docker to 18.09.2 and above.

Go to [official page](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) to download the .dmg file you need. Once done, double-click to open and drag Docker into the Application folder.

View the version of installed Docker:

```shell
docker version
```

**For more details, please see the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/).**

### Install Python2.7 and Python runtime dependency package

> + OpenEdge provides Python Runtime, which supports running code written in Python2.7. If you run OpenEdge in **native process mode**, you **MUST** firstly install Python2.7 and the package actually use. But, If you plan to start in ***docker container mode***, you do not need to perform the following steps.

Install by using HomeBrew(Recommended):

```shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"  // Install HomeBrew
brew install python@2
pip install protobuf grpcio
```

***Notice***: Execute the following command to check the installed version of Python:

```shell
python -V
```
 
Specify the default version of Python with following command:

```shell
alias python=/yourpath/python2.7
```

## Deploy OpenEdge

### Preparation Before Deployment

**Statement**:

+ The following is an example of the deployment and startup of OpenEdge on Darwin system. It is assumed that the environment required for OpenEdge operation has been [configured](#Environment-Configuration).
+ The Darwin system mentioned below is based on the Darwin High Sierra Version 10.13.6 with a CPU architecture of x86_64. Execute the command `uname -ar` and get the result like this:

Starting OpenEdge containerization mode requires the running device to complete the installation and operation of Docker. You can install it by referring to [Steps above](#Install-Docker).

### Deployment Process

- **Step1**: [Download](../Resources-download.md) OpenEdge;
- **Step2**: Open the terminal and enter the OpenEdge directory for decompression:
	- Execute the command `tar -zxvf openedge-xxx.tar.gz`;
- **Step3**: After the decompression operation is completed, enter the OpenEdge package directory in the terminal, open a new terminal at the same time, execute the command `docker stats`, display the running status of the container in the installed docker, and then execute the command `bin/openedge -w .`, respectively. Observe the contents displayed by the two terminals;
- **Step4**: If the results are consistent, it means that OpenEdge has started normally.

***Notice:*** The official download page only provides the docker mode executable file. If you want to run in process mode, please refer to [Build-OpenEdge-From-Source.md](./Build-OpenEdge-from-Source.md)

### Start Deployment

As mentioned above, download OpenEdge from the [Download page](../Resources-download.md) first (also can compile from source, see [Build-OpenEdge-From-Source.md](./Build-OpenEdge-from-Source.md)), then open the terminal to enter OpenEdge directory for decompression. After successful decompression, you can find that the openedge directory mainly includes `bin`, `etc`, `var`, etc., as shown in the following picture:

![OpenEdge directory](../../images/setup/openedge-dir.png)

The `bin` directory stores the openedge executable binary file, the `etc` directory stores the configuration of OpenEdge, and the `var` directory stores the configuration and resources for the modules of OpenEdge.

Then, open a new terminal and execute the command `docker stats` to view the running status of the container in the installed docker, as shown in the following picture:

![view the docker containers status](../../images/setup/docker-stats-before.png)

It can be found that the current system does not have a docker container running.

Then, go to the decompressed folder of OpenEdge, execute the command `bin/openedge -w .` In the another terminal, observe the log of OpenEdge startup, as shown below:

![OpenEdge startup log](../../images/setup/docker-openedge-start.png)

At the same time, observe the terminal that shows the running status of the container, as shown in the following picture:

![running containers](../../images/setup/docker-stats-after.png)

Obviously, OpenEdge has been successfully launched.

As mentioned above, if the steps are executed correctly, OpenEdge can be quickly deployed and started on the Darwin system.
