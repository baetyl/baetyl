export GOPATH="${HOME}/go"
export GOROOT="$(brew --prefix golang)/libexec"
export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin:${GOROOT}/bin"
```

Make the environment variable take effect:

```shell
source yourfile
```

Create the GOPATH specified directory:

```shell
test -d "${GOPATH}" || mkdir "${GOPATH}"
```

+ Install by using binary file

Go to [related resources](../Resources-download.md) to complete the download, then:

```shell
tar -C /usr/local -zxf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz  # Decompress the Go archive to the /usr/local directory
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin # Configuring environment variables
export GOPATH=yourpath  # GOPATH setting
go env  # View Go's environment variables
go version # View Go's version
```

_**Notice**: OpenEdge requires that the compiled version of Go be above 1.10.0 ._

### Install Docker

Go to [official page](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) to download the .dmg file you need. Once done, double-click to open and drag Docker into the Application folder.

![Install On Darwin](../../images/setup/docker-install-on-mac.png)

View the version of installed Docker:

```shell
docker version
```

## Download Source Code

After completing the compilation environment configuration according to the corresponding environment, go to the [OpenEdge Github Page](https://github.com/baidu/openedge)to download source code of openedge.

```shell
go get github.com/baidu/openedge
```

## Compile the Source Code

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make # Compile
```

After the compilation is completed, the following four executable files will be generated in the root directory:

```shell
openedge
openedge-hub
openedge-function
openedge-remote-mqtt
```

```shell
make image # build the images
```

The following four images are generated by the above command:

```shell
openedge-hub:build
openedge-function:build
openedge-remote-mqtt:build
openedge-function-runtime-python27:build
```

View the generated images with the following command:

```shell
docker images
```

## Install OpenEdge

Install to default path: /usr/local。

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make install
```

Specify the installation path, such as installing into the output directory:

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make PREFIX=output install
```

## Run the OpenEdge

If the program is already installed to the default path: /usr/local。

```shell
openedge -w example/docker # docker mode
openedge # native node
```

If the program has been installed to the specified path, such as installing into the output directory:

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
output/bin/openedge -w example/docker # docker container mode
output/bin/openedge # native process mode
```

**Notice**：

1. If run in docker container mode, the container runtime status can be viewed via the `docker stats` command.
2. To use your own image, you need to modify the ***entry*** of the modules and functions in the application configuration to specify your own image.
3. For custom configuration, follow the instructions in [Configuration Interpretation](../tutorials/Config-interpretation.md) to make the relevant settings.

## Uninstall OpenEdge

If it is the default installation:

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make clean # Can be used to clean executable files generated by compilation
make uninstall
```

If the installation path is specified, for example, it is installed into the output directory.

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make clean # Can be used to clean executable files generated by compilation
make PREFIX=output uninstall
```
