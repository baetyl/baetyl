# Build OpenEdge From Source

Compared to the quick installation of OpenEdge, users can compile OpenEdge from source to get the latest features.

Before compiling, users should configure the build environment. So this article consist of two parts: **environment configuration** and **source code compilation**.

## Environment Configuration

### Linux Platform

#### Install Go

Go to [related resources](../Resources-download.md) to complete the download, then:

```shell
tar -C /usr/local -zxf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz  # Decompress the Go archive to the /usr/local directory
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin # Configuring environment variables
export GOPATH=yourpath  # GOPATH setting
go env  # View Go's environment variables
go version # View Go's version
```

**NOTE**: OpenEdge requires that the compiled version of Go should be above 1.10.0.

#### Install the container runtime

In **docker** container mode, OpenEdge relies on docker container runtime. If `docker` is not installed yet, users can install the latest version of docker (for Linux-like systems) with the following command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

View the version of installed docker:

```shell
docker version
```

**NOTE**：According to the [Official Release Log](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#18092), the version of docker lower than 18.09.2 has some security implications. It is recommended to install/update the docker to 18.09.2 and above.

**For more details, please see the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/).**

### Darwin Platform

#### Install Go

- Install by using HomeBrew

```shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"  # install homebrew
brew install go
```

Modify the environment configuration file after the installation is complete.(e.g: ~/.bash_profile)：

```shell
export GOPATH="${HOME}/go"
export GOROOT="$(brew --prefix golang)/libexec"
export PATH="$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin:${GOROOT}/bin"
```

Make the environment variable take effect:

```shell
source yourfile
```

Create the GOPATH specified directory:

```shell
test -d "${GOPATH}" || mkdir "${GOPATH}"
```

- Install by using binary file

Go to [related resources](../Resources-download.md) to complete the download, then:

```shell
tar -C /usr/local -zxf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz  # Decompress the Go archive to the /usr/local directory
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin # Configuring environment variables
export GOPATH=yourpath  # GOPATH setting
go env  # View Go's environment variables
go version # View Go's version
```

**NOTE**: OpenEdge requires that the compiled version of Go should be above 1.10.0.

#### Install the container runtime

Go to [official page](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) to download the .dmg file you need. Once done, double-click to open and drag docker into the application folder.

![Install On Darwin](../../images/setup/docker-install-on-mac.png)

View the version of installed docker:

```shell
docker version
```

## Source Code Compilation

### Download Source Code

After completing the compilation environment configuration according to the corresponding environment, go to the [OpenEdge Github Page](https://github.com/baidu/openedge) to download source code of openedge.

```shell
go get github.com/baidu/openedge
```

### Build Docker Image

In container mode, docker starts the module by running the image corresponding to each module, so build the mirror first with the following command:

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make image # build image
```

**Note**: Under the Darwin system, users need to specify the compilation parameters because the compiled images themselves are based on Linux system:

```shell
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 make image
```

The following six docker images are generated by the above command:

```shell
openedge-agent:latest
openedge-hub:latest
openedge-function-manager:latest
openedge-remote-mqtt:latest
openedge-function-python27:latest
openedge-function-node85:latest
```

View the generated images with the following command:

```shell
docker images
```

### Compile

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make rebuild
```

After the compilation is completed, the following five executable files will be generated in the root directory and each module directory, respectively:

```shell
openedge
openedge-agent/openedge-agent
openedge-hub/openedge-hub
openedge-function-manager/openedge-function-manager
openedge-remote-mqtt/openedge-remote-mqtt
```

In addition, a total of five files named `package.zip` are generated in each module directory.

### Install

Install to default path: `/usr/local`。

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make install # install for docker mode with example configuration
make install-native # install for native mode with example configuration
```

Specify the installation path, such as installing into the output directory:

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make install PREFIX=output
```

### Run

If the program is already installed to the default path: `/usr/local`。

```shell
sudo openedge start
```

If the program has been installed to the specified path, such as installing into the output directory:

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
sudo ./output/bin/openedge start
```

**NOTE**:

1. After the openedge is started, you can check if the openedge has run successfully by `ps -ef | grep "openedge"` and determine the parameters used at startup. And you can check the log file for details. Log files are stored by default in the `var/log/openedge` directory of the working directory.
2. If run in docker container mode, the container runtime status can be viewed via the `docker stats` command.
3. To use your own image, you need to modify the **image** of the modules and functions in the application configuration to specify your own image.
4. For custom configuration, follow the instructions in [Configuration Interpretation](../tutorials/Config-interpretation.md) to make the relevant settings.

### Uninstall

If it is the default installation:

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make clean # Can be used to clean executable files generated by compilation
make uninstall # Uninstall if you install in docker mode
make uninstall-native # Uninstall if you install in native mode
```

If the installation path is specified, for example, it is installed into the output directory.

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/baidu/openedge
make clean # Can be used to clean executable files generated by compilation
make uninstall PREFIX=output # Uninstall if you install in docker mode
make uninstall-native PREFIX=output # Uninstall if you install in native mode
```
