# OpenEdge Advantages

- **Shielding computing framework**: OpenEdge provides two official computing modules(**Local Function Module** and **Python2.7 Runtime Module**), also supports customize module(which can be written in any programming language or any machine learning framework).
- **Simplified application production**: OpenEdge combines with **Cloud Management Suite** of BIE and many other productions of Baidu Cloud(such as [CFC](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/cfc.html), [Infinite](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/infinite.html), [Jarvis](http://di.baidu.com/product/jarvis), [IoT EasyInsight](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/ist.html), [AIM-Intelligent industrial quality inspection solution](https://cloud.baidu.com/solution/aim.html) to provide data calculation, AI inference, storage, visible display, and more abilities.
- **Simplified runtime environment build**: OpenEdge builds module image due to Dockerfile in container mode.
- **Create once, reuse multiple times**: OpenEdge introduces volume, and together with BIE cloud management suite, achieves the purpose of `create once, reuse multiple times` about configuration.
- **Deploy on demand**: OpenEdge takes modularization mode and splits functions to multiple independent modules. Developers can select some modules which they need to deploy.
- **Flexible adaptation**: OpenEdge supports X86 and ARM CPU processors, as well as Linux and Darwin operating systems.
- **Customize development**: OpenEdge provides SDK that allows developers to develop a customize runtime or module.
