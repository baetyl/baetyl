## Master Configuration

The Master configuration and application configuration are separated. The default configuration file is `etc/baetyl/conf.yml` in the working directory. The configuration is interpreted as follows:

```yaml
mode: The default value is `docker`, running mode of services. **docker** container mode or **native** process mode
grace: The default value is `30s`, the timeout for waiting services to gracefully exit.
server: API Server configuration of Master.
  address: The default value can be read from environment variable `BAETYL_MASTER_API_ADDRESS`, address of API Server.
  timeout: The default value is `30s`, timeout of API Server.
logger: Logger configuration
  path: The default is `empty` (none configuration), that is, it does not write to the file. If the path is specified, it writes to the file.
  level: The default value is `info`, log level, support `debug`、`info`、`warn` and `error`.
  format: The default value is `text`, log print format, support `text` and `json`.
  age:
    max: The default value is `15`, means maximum number of days the log file is kept.

      policy: The default value is `always`, restart policy, support `no`, `always` and `on-failure`. And `no` means none restart, `always` means always restart, `on-failure` means restart the service if it exits abnormally.
      backoff:
        min: The default value is `1s`, minimum interval of restart.
        max: The default value is `5m`, maximum interval of restart.
        factor: The default value is `2`, factor of interval increase.
    resources: Service instance resource limit configuration in docker container mode
      cpu:
        cpus: The percentage of CPU available of the service instance, for example `1.5`, means that `1.5` CPU cores can be used.

### baetyl-hub

```yaml
listen: [MUST] Listening address, for example
  - tcp://0.0.0.0:1883
  - ssl://0.0.0.0:1884
  - ws://:8080/mqtt
  - wss://:8884/mqtt
certificate: SSL/TLS certificate authentication configuration, if `ssl` or `wss` is enabled, it must be configured.
  ca: Server CA certificate path
  key: Server private key path
  cert: Server public key path
principals: ACL configuration. If not configured, client cannot connect to this Hub, support username/password and certificate authentication.
  - username: Username for client non-ssl connection
    password: Password for client connection
    permissions:
      - action: Operation type of permission. `pub` means publish permission, `sub` means subscription permission.
        permit: List of topics allowed by the operation type, support `+` and `#` wildcards.
  - username: Username for client ssl connection
    permissions:
      - action: Operation type of permission. `pub` means publish permission, `sub` means subscription permission.
        permit: List of topics allowed by the operation type, support `+` and `#` wildcards.
subscriptions: Topic routing configuration
  - source:
      topic: subscribe topic
      qos: QoS of topic
    target:
      topic: publish topic
      qos: QoS of topic
message: MQTT message related configuration
  length:
    max: The default value is `32k`, which means maximum message length that can be allowed to be transmitted. The maximum can be set to 268,435,455 Byte(about 256MB).
  ingress: Message receive configuration
    qos0:
      buffer:
        size: The default value is `10000`, means the number of messages that can be cached in memory with QoS0. Increasing the cache can improve the performance of message reception. If the device loses power, it will directly discard the message with QoS0.
    qos1:
      buffer:
        size:  The default value is `100`, means the message cache size of waiting for persistent with QoS1. Increasing the cache can improve the performance of message reception, but the potential risk is that the service will exit abnormally(such as device power failure), it will lose the cached message, and will not reply(puback). The service exits normally and waits for the cached message to be processed without losing data.
      batch:
        max:  The default value is `50`, means the maximum number of messages with QoS1 can be insert into the database (persistence). After the message is persisted, it will reply with confirmation(ack).
      cleanup:
        retention:  The default value is `48h`, means the time that the message with QoS1 can be saved in the database. Messages that exceed this time will be physically deleted during cleanup.
        interval:  The default value is `1m`, means cleanup interval with QoS1.
  egress: Message publish configuration
    qos0:
      buffer:
        size:  The default value is `10000`, means the number of messages to be sent in the in-memory cache wit QoS0. If the device is powered off, the message will be discarded directly. After the buffer is full, the newly pushed message will be discarded directly.
    qos1:
      buffer:
        size:  The default value is `100`, means the size of the message buffer is not confirmed(ack) after the message with QoS1 is sent. After the buffer is full, the new message is no longer read, and the message in the cache is always acknowledged(ack). After the message with QoS1 is sent to the client, it waits for the client to confirm(puback). If the client does not reply within the specified time, the message will be resent until the client replies or the session is closed.
      batch:
        max:  The default value is `50`, means the maximum number of messages read from the database in batches.
      retry:
        interval:  The default value is `20s`, means the re-publish interval of message.
  offset: Message serial number persistence related configuration
    buffer:
      size:  The default value is `10000`, means the size of the cache queue for the serial number of the message that was acknowledged(ack). For example, three messages with QoS1 and serial numbers 1, 2, and 3 are sent to the client in batches. The client confirms the messages of sequence numbers 1 and 3. At this time, sequence number 1 will be queued and persisted. Although sequence number 3 has been confirmed, it still has to wait for the serial number 2 to be confirmed before entering the column. This design can ensure that the message can be recovered from the persistent serial number after the service restarts abnormally, ensuring that the message is not lost, but the message retransmission will occur, and therefore the message with QoS 2 is not supported.
    batch:
      max:  The default value is `100`, means the maximum number of batches of message serial numbers can be insert into the database.
logger: Logger configuration
  path: The default is `empty` (none configuration), that is, it does not write to the file. If the path is specified, it writes to the file.
  level: The default value is `info`, log level, support `debug`、`info`、`warn` and `error`.
  format: The default value is `text`, log print format, support `text` and `json`.
  age:
    max: The default value is `15`, means maximum number of days the log file is kept.
  size:
    max: The default value is `50`, log file size limit, default unit is `MB`.
  backup:
    max: The default value is `15`, the maximum number of log files to keep.
status: Service status configuration
  logging:
    enable: The default value is `false`, means whether to print baetyl status information.
    interval: The default value is `60s`, means interval of printing baetyl status information.

  dir: The default value is `var/db/baetyl/data`, means database storage directory.
