# Message transferring among devices with Hub Service

**Statement**

- The operating system used in this test is Ubuntu 18.04
- The [MQTTBox](../Resources.html#mqttbox-download) is used as MQTT client in this test

Different from [Device connect to Hub Service](Device-connect-to-hub-service.md), if you want to transfer MQTT messages among multiple MQTT clients, you need to configure the connect information, topic permission, and router rules. More detailed configuration of Hub service, please refer to [Hub service configuration](Config-interpretation.html#baetyl-hub).

This document uses the TCP connection method as an example to test the message routing and forwarding capabilities of the Hub service.

## Workflow

- Step 1: Install Baetyl and its example configuration, more details please refer to [Quickly install Baetyl](../install/Quick-Install.md)
- Step 2: Modify the configuration according to the usage requirements, and then execute `sudo systemctl start baetyl` to start the Baetyl in Docker container mode, or execute `sudo systemctl restart baetyl` to restart the Baetyl. Then execute the command `sudo systemctl status baetyl` to check whether baetyl is running.
- Step 3: MQTTBox connect to Hub Service by TCP connection method, more detailed contents please refer to [Device connect to Hub Service](Device-connect-to-hub-service.md).
  - If connect successfully, then subscribe the MQTT topic due to the configuration of Hub Service.
  - If connect unsuccessfully, then retry `Step 3` operation until it connect successfully.
- Step 4: Check the publishing and receiving messages via MQTTBox.

## Message Routing Test

The Baetyl application configuration is replaced with the following configuration:

```yaml
# /usr/local/var/db/baetyl/application.yml
version: V2
services:
  - name: hub
    image: 'hub.baidubce.com/baetyl/baetyl-hub'
    replica: 1
    ports:
      - '1883:1883'
    mounts:
      - name: localhub-conf
        path: etc/baetyl
        readonly: true
      - name: localhub_data
        path: var/db/baetyl/data
      - name: log-V1
        path: var/log/baetyl
volumes:
  - name: localhub-conf
    path: var/db/baetyl/localhub-conf/V1
  - name: log-V1
    path: var/db/baetyl/log
  - name: localhub_data
    path: var/db/baetyl/localhub_data
```

The Baetyl Hub service configuration is replaced with the following configuration:

```yaml
# /usr/local/var/db/baetyl/localhub-conf/service.yml
listen:
  - tcp://0.0.0.0:1883
principals:
  - username: 'test'
    password: 'hahaha'
    permissions:
      - action: 'pub'
        permit: ['#']
      - action: 'sub'
        permit: ['#']
subscriptions:
  - source:
      topic: 't'
    target:
      topic: 't/topic'
logger:
  path: var/log/baetyl/service.log
  level: 'debug'
```

As configured above, message routing rules depends on the `subscriptions` configuration item, which means that messages published to the topic `t` will be forwarded to all devices(users, or mqtt clients) that subscribe the topic `t/topic`.

_**NOTE**: In the above configuration, the permitted topics which are configured in `permit` item support the `+` and `#` wildcards configuration. More detailed contents of `+` and `#` wildcards will be explained as follows._

**`#` wildcard**

For [MQTT protocol](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html), the number sign(`#` U+0023) is a wildcard character that matches any number of levels within a topic. The multi-level wildcard represents the parent and any number of child levels. The multi-level wildcard character MUST be specified either on its own or following a topic level separator(`/` U+002F). In either case it MUST be the last character specified in the topic.

For example, the configuration of `permit` item of `sub` action is `sport/tennis/player1/#`, it would receive messages published using these topic names:

- `sport/tennis/player1`
- `sport/tennis/player1/ranking`
- `sport/tennis/player1/score/wimbledon`

Besides, topic `sport/#` also matches the singular `sport`, since `#` includes the parent level.

For Baetyl, if the topic `#` is configured in the `permit` item list(whether `pub` action or `sub` action), there is no need to configure any other topics. And the specified account(depends on `username/password`) will have permission to all legal topics of MQTT protocol.

**`+` wildcard**

As described in the MQTT protocol, the plus sign(`+` U+002B) is a wildcard character that matches only one topic level. The single-level wildcard can be used at any level in the topic, including first and last levels. Where it is used it MUST occupy an entire level of the topic. It can be used at more than one level in the topic and can be used in conjunction with the multi-level wildcard.

For example, topic `sport/tennis/+` matches `sport/tennis/player1` and `sport/tennis/player2`, but not `sport/tennis/player1/ranking`. Also, because the single-level wildcard matches only a single level, `sport/+` does not match `sport` but it does match `sport/`.

For Baetyl, if the topic `+` is configured in the `permit` item list(whether `pub` action or `sub` action), the specified account(depends on `username/password`) will have permission to all single-level legal topics of MQTT protocol.

**NOTE**: For MQTT protocol, wildcard **ONLY** can be used in Topic Filter(`sub` action), and **MUST NOT** be used in Topic Name(`pub` action). But in the design of Baetyl, in order to enhance the flexibility of the topic permissions configuration, wildcard configured in `permit` item(whether in `pub` action or `sub` action) is valid, as long as the topic of the published or subscribed meets the requirements of MQTT protocol is ok. In particular, wildcards ( `#` and `+` ) policies are recommended for developers who need to configure a large number of publish and subscribe topics in the `principals` configuration.

### Message Transfer Test Among Devices

The message transferring and routing workflow among devices are as follows:

![Message transfer test among devices](../images/guides/trans/trans-flow.png)

Specifically, as shown in the above figure, **client1**, **client2**, and **client3** respectively establish a connection to Baetyl with Hub Service, **client1** has the permission to publish messages to the topic `t`, and **client2** and **client3** respectively have the permission to subscribe topic `t` and `t/topic`.

Once the connection to Baetyl for the above three clients with Hub Service is established, as the configuration of the above three clients, **client2** and **client3** will respectively get the message from **client1** published to the topic `t` to Hub Service.

In particular, **client1**, **client2**, and **client3** can be combined into one client, and the new client will have the permission to publish messages to the topic `t`, with permissions to subscribe messages to the topic `t` and `t/topic`. Here, using MQTTBox as the new client, click the `Add subscriber` button to subscribe the topic `t` and `t/topic`. 

Then clicks the `Publish` button to publish message with the payload `This is a new message.` and with the topic `t` to Hub service, you will find this message is received by MQTTBox with the subscribed topics `t` and `t/topic`. More detailed contents are as below.

In summary, the message forwarding and routing test between devices based on Hub service is completed through MQTTBox.
